  For each task below, explain why the code is incorrect, what type of error that is, and how to fix it.
*/

//Task 1: Print out "Hello World"
System.out.print("Hello World);
/* the code is incorrect because there is a missing quotation mark in ("Hello World). 
This is a syntax error, and to fix it, you just add another quotation mark(") after the "d" in "World" 
*/
//Task 2: Print out "Hello World"
System.out.print(Hello World);
/*
 The code is incorrect as it doesn't print out the words Hello World at all, and is missing quotations to declare the Hello World as words. 
 To fix it, you would need to insert Hello World in between 2 quotation marks like this: ("Hello World")

//Task 3: Print out "Hello World"
System.Out.Print("Hello World");

//Task 4: Print out "Hello World"
